<h5>It seems you're asking about NVIDIA RTX, which is centered around advanced graphics technology and gaming. Here’s a detailed overview:</h5>
<h5> NVIDIA RTX Overview</h5>

<h5>1. Ray Tracing:</h5>
 <h5>  - Definition: Ray tracing simulates the way light interacts with objects to create more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in real-time.</h5>
 <h5>  - Impact on Gaming: This technology significantly enhances visual fidelity, making games look more lifelike compared to traditional rasterization techniques.</h5>
 
<h5> AI and Deep Learning:</h5>
<h5>   - DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling): This is one of the hallmark features of RTX cards. DLSS uses AI to upscale lower resolution images, providing high-quality visuals without the performance drop seen in native rendering.</h5>
 <h5>  - Performance Boost: It allows for higher frame rates without compromising on image quality, enabling smoother gaming experiences.</h5>

<h5>3. Series of Innovation:</h5>
  <h5> - RTX 20 Series: The introduction of RTX was marked by the 20 series, which first brought ray tracing to consumers.</h5>
<h5>   - RTX 30 and 40 Series: These newer iterations have improved performance and efficiency, pushing boundaries further in gaming and content creation.</h5>

<h5>4. Software and Game Support:</h5>
  <h5> - Many popular games now support RTX features, including titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Control, and Battlefield V. The list of supported games continuously grows.</h5>

<h5>5. Creation Tools:</h5>
<h5>   - NVIDIA Studio: RTX GPUs are not just for gaming; they also power creative software used for 3D rendering, video editing, and graphic design, ensuring that creators can utilize the hardware's full potential.</h5>

<h5> Conclusion</h5>

<h5>In summary, NVIDIA RTX represents a significant leap forward in graphics technology, bringing realistic visuals to gaming and creative applications through ray tracing and AI enhancements. If you have specific aspects or questions about NVIDIA RTX that you’d like to dive deeper into, just let me know!</h5>

<h5>La GeForce RTX 3050 fait partie de la génération de GeForce RTX 30 qui fonctionne sous une architecture Ampère. Cette carte embarque une puce GA106 avec 12 milliards de transistors et une gravure de 8 nm. Elle est moins fournie en unité de calcul, néanmoins elle possède 2560 unités classiques.</h5>
<h4>rtx 3060</h4>
<img src="rtx 3060.webp" alt="rtx3060">
<h5>The real new GeForce RTX 3060 does indeed use the identifier DEV_24C7, although we don't yet know what changes it will offer...</h5>

<h4>rtx 3090</h4>
<img src="1024.png" alt="rtx3090">
<h5>The GeForce RTX 3090 is an enthusiast-class graphics card from NVIDIA, launched on September 1, 2020. Built on the 8nm process and based on the GA102 GPU, in its GA102-300-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate.</h5>


<h4>rtx 4060</h4>
<img src="rtx 4060.jpg" alt="rtx4060">
<h5>RTX 4060 offers excellent power efficiency, easily beats the RTX 3060 12GB and supports DLSS and framerate generation. However, it is not a convincing upgrade over previous generation mid-range cards and its price could be lower.</h5>


<h4>rtx 4070</h4>
<img src="rtx 4070.jpg" alt="rtx4070">
<h5>On the NVIDIA side, let's take the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 as an example. GeForce is a brand of NVIDIA graphics processing units designed for gaming. The "RTX" designation means that the GPU is equipped with "ray tracing", a feature that improves lighting in many modern games.</h5>


<h4>rtx 4090</h4>
